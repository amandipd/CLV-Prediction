# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer lifetime value and analyze customer behavior patterns. Currently under development.

## 🎯 Goals
- Predict Customer Lifetime Value using demographics and purchase data
- Segment customers into meaningful groups
- Identify at-risk customers (churn prediction)
- Compare multiple regression models

## 📊 Data
Customer data including demographics, purchase history, membership type, and satisfaction metrics.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- Python
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- Machine Learning (Regression, Clustering, Classification)
- Data Analysis & Visualization

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing value imputation, boolean conversion, one-hot encoding, standardization)
- Linear Regression model with performance metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)
- Random Forest Regressor with performance metrics (R², MSE, RMSE)
- User input prediction function
- Modular code for easy extension

## 🧩 Planned Extensions
- XGBoost regression model
- Customer segmentation (clustering)
- Churn risk classification
- Model comparison module
- Model explainability (SHAP/LIME)
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit or Dash)
- Automated reporting (PDF/HTML)
- REST API for predictions
